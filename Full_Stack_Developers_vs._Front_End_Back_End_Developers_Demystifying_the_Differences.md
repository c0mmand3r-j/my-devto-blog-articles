# Full Stack Developers vs. Front End/Back End Developers: Demystifying the Differences

------------

In the world of web development, the terms "front end" and "back end" have long been used to describe the two primary aspects of creating a website or web application. However, in recent years, a new term has emerged: the "full stack" developer. Despite this trend, there remains some confusion over what each role entails and whether or not they are becoming one.

To start, a front end developer is responsible for the client-side of a website or web application. This includes everything that the user interacts with, such as the layout, color scheme, and overall look and feel. Front end developers are usually skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have a keen eye for design and user experience.

On the other hand, a back end developer is responsible for the server-side of a website or web application. This includes the database, server, and application logic. Back end developers are usually skilled in programming languages such as PHP, Ruby, or Python and are responsible for ensuring that the website or web application functions correctly and that the data is stored securely.

The emergence of full stack developers is due to the fact that web development has become increasingly complex and intertwined over the years. Full stack developers are individuals who are skilled in both front end and back end development. They have a deep understanding of how the entire web development process works, from user interface design to database management.

## FrontEnd and Backend titles vanishing
One reason why the front end and back end are becoming one is that web development tools have become more sophisticated. With the advent of tools like Node.js, which allows developers to write both client-side and server-side code in JavaScript, it has become easier for developers to work on both the front end and back end.

Another reason is that businesses are looking for developers who can do it all. As the digital landscape becomes increasingly competitive, businesses want developers who can work on multiple aspects of a project, rather than having to hire different developers for each aspect.

However, there are still differences between front end and back end development, and it is important for businesses to understand these differences when hiring developers. Front end developers have a keen eye for design and user experience, while back end developers are skilled in programming languages and database management.

The front end and back end are not necessarily dying; they are simply becoming part of a broader skill set. As web development becomes more complex and intertwined, developers who can work on both the front end and back end will become increasingly valuable. Nonetheless, there are still differences between front end and back end development, and it is important to understand these differences when hiring developers.
